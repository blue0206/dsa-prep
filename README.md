# My Coding Interview Preparation Journey

This repository documents my structured study of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Core CS concepts using C++. My goal is to master the fundamentals required for top-tier software engineering roles.

The primary roadmap is based on [Striver's A2Z DSA Course Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2).

## How to Use This Repo

-   Each major "Step" from the A2Z sheet is a section below.
-   Solutions to problems are organized in folders corresponding to these steps (e.g., `/03-Arrays/`).
-   As I complete a topic, I will check it off the list.
